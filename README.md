# JunitTesting

### 1. What Is Junit:
JUnit is a unit testing framework for Java programming language. It plays a crucial role test-driven development, and is a family of unit testing frameworks collectively known as xUnit.
&nbsp;JUnit promotes the idea of "first testing then coding", which emphasizes on setting up the test data for a piece of code that can be tested first and then implemented. This approach is like "test a little, code a little, test a little, code a little." It increases the productivity of the programmer and the stability of program code, which in turn reduces the stress on the programmer and the time spent on debugging.

to identify a class as testing class, you should write it in the testing package, and it should 
contains testing annotations by necessity.
Testing annotations:
 
• @Before&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• @BeforeClass

• @Test

• @After&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• @AfterClas

### 2. What is unit test:
Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application, called units, are individually and independently checked for proper operation. This testing methodology is performed during the development process by software developers and sometimes QA personnel. The main goal of unit testing is to isolate the code written for testing and to determine if it works as intended.
and is an important step in the development process, because if done correctly, it can help detect early flaws in the code that may be difficult to find in later testing phases.
